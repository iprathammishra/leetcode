// 19. **Pond Sizes:** You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.

// Example: <br>
// Input:

// 0 2 1 0
// 0 1 0 1
// 1 1 0 1
// 0 1 0 1

// Output: 2, 3, 1 (in any order)
