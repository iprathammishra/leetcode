# Some along-the-way Questions.

### Why we use `nullptr` instead of `NULL`?

In modern C++, it's recommended to use `nullptr` instead of `NULL`or `0` for several reasons:

1. **Type Safety:** `nullptr` is a keyword that has a specific type - `nullptr_t`, whereas `NULL` or `0` are integer literals. This means `nullptr` is a type-safe and can be used with any pointer type, reducing the chances of type-related bugs.
2. **Avoid Ambiguity:** Using `0` or `NULL` can lead to ambiguity, as they could be interpreted as integers or pointers. `nullptr` explicitly represents a null pointer, making the code's intent clear.
3. **Compatibility:** `nullptr` is standard in C++11 and later, ensuring code compatilibity and readability across different compilers and C++ versions.

In short, use `nullptr` for improved type safety, clarity, and compatibility in modern C++ code.

### What is the difference between `implicit` and `explicit` in programming?

In programming, `implicit` and `explicit` refer to different ways of performing operations or type conversions:

1. **Implicit:** Implicit operations or type conversions happen automatically by the language or compiler without requiring explicit instructions from the programmer. For example, when you assign a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., assigning an integer to a floating-point number), the conversion is done implicitly.
2. **Explicit:** Explicit operations or type conversions require specific instructions from the programmer to indicate their intent. This ensures clarity and precision. For example, in C++, you can use the `static_cast` keyword to explicitly convert one data type to another.

In short, `implicit` actions occur automatically, while `explicit` actions require deliberate programmer intervention for clarity and control.

### Why do we use `&` and `const` with `string` datatype as a paramter in some methods in C++?

Using `&` and `const` with the `string` datatype as parameters in C++ methods is an important practice for optimizing performance and ensuring the safety of your code. Let's discuss this in the context of a potential interview question:

**Interviewer:** Can you explain why we often use `&` and `const` with `string` datatype as parameters in C++ methods?

**You:** Certainly. Using `&` and `const` with `string` datatype in C++ is a good practice for several reasons:

1. **Passing by Reference (`&`)**

- When we use `&`, we are passing the string parameter by reference, which means that we are not making a copy of the string when the function is called. This can significantly improve performance, especially for large strings, because copying a string can be computationally expensive.

2. **`const` Qualifier:**

- The `const` keyword is used to indicate that the function does not modify the string passes as a paramter. This is an important aspect of code safety and clarity.
- Using `const` prevents accidental modification of the input string within the function. It's a way of expressing the function's intent and ensuring that the function behaves as expected without altering the caller's data.

3. **Efficiency:**

- Using `const` with string parameters is not just about safety; it can also enable certain optimizations by the C++ compiler. The compiler knows that the function won't modify the string, so it can make certain assumptions and apply optimizations accordingly.

4. **Compatibility:**

- Functions that accept `const` references as parameters can be called with both constant (read-only) and non-constant (modifiable) strings. This allow you to use the same function for various scenarios without having to create multiple overloads.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of `&` and `const` with `string` parameters:

```cpp
void processString(const std::string& str) {
    // This function takes a constant reference to a string, indicating that it won't modify the input string.
    // It's safe and efficient for processing strings.
    // ...
}

int main() {
    std::string text = "Hello, World!";
    const std::string readOnlyText = "This is read-only.";

    processString(text);          // OK to pass a non-constant string.
    processString(readOnlyText);  // OK to pass a constant (read-only) string.

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `processString` takes a `const` reference to a string, allowing you to pass both non-constant and constant strings to the function while ensuring safety and efficiency. It also communicates the intent that the function doesn't modify the input string.

### Is there a way to create a matrix with O(N) or any other time complexity better than O(N^2)?

Creating a matrix with O(N) time complexity is not possible beacuse you need to initialize N\*N elements in the matrix, which inherently requires at least O(N^2) operations.

### Is there a way to travese a tree iteratively. If yes, why do we not prefer it much.

Yes, it is possible to traverse tree iteratively, and in fact, iterative tree traversal is commonly used, especially for large trees or when you want to conserve memory or avoid the overhead of function call recursion.

The main reason why iterative tree traversal is not preferred as much as recursive traversal in many educational or illustrative contexts is that recursive traversal is often easier to understand and implement. It tends to be more straightforward to teach and comprehend, especially for those who are new to data structures and algorithms. Recursive traversal can akso make code more concise and readable.

However, there are some reasons to prefer iterative tree traversal:

1. **Reduced Memory Usage:** Recursive traversal typically uses the call stack, which can consume a lot of memory for deep trees. Iterative traversal often uses a data structure (e.g., a stack or queue) to manage nodes, which can be more memory-efficient for deep trees.
2. **Explicit Control:** Iterative traversal gives you more explicit control over the traversal process, which can be helpful in certain situations, such as when you need to interrupt or modify the traversal logic based on specific conditions.
3. **Performance:** In some cases, iterative can be faster than recursive traversal due to reduced function call overhead. This can be important for time-critical applications.

Here's a simple example of iterative inorder traversal.

```cpp
void iterativeInorderTraversal(Node *root) {
    stack<Node*> s;
    Node *current = root;

    while (current || !s.empty()) {
        while (current) {
            s.push(current);
            current = current->left;
        }
        current = s.top();
        s.pop();
        cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->right;
    }
}
```

Here's a simple example of iterative preorder traversal.

```cpp
void iterativePreorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (!root) return;

    stack<Node*> s;
    s.push(root);

    while (!s.empty()) {
        Node* current = s.top();
        s.pop();
        cout << current->data << " ";

        if (current->right) {
            s.push(current->right);
        }
        if (current->left) {
            s.push(current->left);
        }
    }
}
```

Here's a simple example of iterative postorder traversal.

```cpp
void iterativePostorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (!root) return;

    stack<Node*> s1, s2;
    s1.push(root);

    while (!s1.empty()) {
        Node* current = s1.top();
        s1.pop();
        s2.push(current);

        if (current->left) {
            s1.push(current->left);
        }
        if (current->right) {
            s1.push(current->right);
        }
    }

    while (!s2.empty()) {
        Node* current = s2.top();
        s2.pop();
        cout << current->data << " ";
    }
}
```

### `Follow Up:` Is there a more easier and efficient way than stack that is used here?

Using a stack is a common and efficient way to perform iterative tree traversals, and it's widely used because it provides a straightforward and efficient mechanism to simulate the recursive call stack. In terms of simplicity and efficiency, a stack is a good choice for these traversals.

However, there are alternative data structures and approaches you can for tree traversal, but they may not necessarily be easier or mroe efficient:

1. **Morris Traversal:** Morris Traversal is an efficient and space-saving way to perform in-order and pre-order tree traversals without using an explicit stack. It modifies the tree's structure temporarily to avoid the need for a stack. While it can be more memory-efficient, it's not necessarily easier to understand.
2. **Queue for Level-Order Traversal:** For level-order (BFS) traversal, you can use a queue instead of a stack. While it's conceptually simpler for BFS, it's not applicable to pre-order or post-order traversals, and the nature of the problem may not allow a more efficient alternative.
3. **Threaded Binary Trees:** In threaded binary trees, threads are used to navigate between nodes without a stack or recursion. This approach is complex and typically used in specialized scenarios.

In general, using a stack is the most straightforward and efficient way got iterative tree traversals in most cases. If you are looking for simplicity and readability in your code, it's usually best to stick with the stack-based approach. It's also a widely accepted and understood practice among developers.

### Explain the `deleteNode` operation of `BST`.

Implementation.

```cpp
void deleteNode(int value) {
    Node* parent = nullptr;
    Node* current = root;

    while (current != nullptr && current->data != value) {
        parent = current;
        if (value < current->data) {
            current = current->left;
        } else {
            current = current->right;
        }
    }

    if (current == nullptr) {
        // Value not found in the tree
        return;
    }

    if (current->left == nullptr) {
        if (parent == nullptr) {
            root = current->right;
        } else if (parent->left == current) {
            parent->left = current->right;
        } else {
            parent->right = current->right;
        }
        delete current;
    } else if (current->right == nullptr) {
        if (parent == nullptr) {
            root = current->left;
        } else if (parent->left == current) {
            parent->left = current->left;
        } else {
            parent->right = current->left;
        }
        delete current;
    } else {
        Node* successor = current->right;
        parent = current;
        while (successor->left != nullptr) {
            parent = successor;
            successor = successor->left;
        }

        current->data = successor->data;

        if (parent->left == successor) {
            parent->left = successor->right;
        } else {
            parent->right = successor->right;
        }
        delete successor;
    }
}
```

Let's understand what is going on in here.

```cpp
if (current->left == nullptr) {
    if (parent == nullptr)
        root = current->right;
    else if (parent->left == current)
        parent->left = current->right;
    else
        parent->right = current->right;
    delete current;
}
```

The code mentioned above is the part of the `deleteNode` method in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and handles the case where the node to be deleted (`current`) has no left child. In this case, the code does the following:

1. If `current->left` is `nullptr`, it means that the node to be deleted has no left child.
2. If `parent` is also `nullptr`, it means that the node to be deleted is the root of the BST.
3. If `parent` is not `nullptr`, it means that the node to be deleted is not the root, and we need to update the parent's pointer to the appropriate child node.

- If `parent->left == current`, it means that the node to be deleted is the left child of the parent, so we set `parent->left` to `current->right`. This effectively "removes" `current` from the tree, and the right child of `current` (if it exists) becomes the new left child of `parent`.
- If `parent->left != current`, it means that the node to be deleted is the right child of the parent, so we set `parent->right` to `current->right`. This also effectively removes `current` from the tree, and the right child of `current` (if it exists) becomes the new right child of `parent`.

4. After updating the parent's pointer, we delete the `current` node using `delete current;` to free the memory occupied by the node.

This code handles the case when a node with no child is to be deleted and ensures that the BST remains valid after the deletion. If the deleted node had a right child, that right child becomes the direct child of the parent node, maintaining the binary search tree property.
<br>

Now, let's see this case:

```cpp
Node* successor = current->right;
    parent = current;
    while (successor->left != nullptr) {
        parent = successor;
        successor = successor->left;
    }

    current->data = successor->data;

    if (parent->left == successor) {
        parent->left = successor->right;
    } else {
        parent->right = successor->right;
    }
    delete successor;
```

This code in `deleteNode` handles the case when the node to be deleted (`current`) has both a left and a right child. This is typically the most complex case in BST deletion. Here's what's happening:

1. `Node *successor = current->right;`: In this linem we're initializing the `successor` pointer to the right child of the node to be deleted (`current`). This is because when you delete a node with two children, you need to replace it with the "in-order successor" from its right subtree. The in-order successor is the smallest node in the right subtree, which will preserve the BST's order.
2. `parent = current;`: Wr're also initializing the `parent` pointer to `current`. We'll use this `parent` pointer to keep track of the parent of the `successor` as we search for the in-order successor.
3. The `while (successor->left != nullptr)` loop is used to find the in-order successor. It iteratively traverses the left children of the `successor` node until it reaches the smallest (leftmost) node in the right subtree.
4. `current->data = successor->data;`: Once we've found the in-order successor, we copy the data of the in-order successor into the `current` node. This effectively "replaces" the `current` node with its in-order successor.
5. The `if (parent->left == successor)` block or the `else` block that follows it is used to update the parent's pointer to the `succcessor` node.

- If `parent->left == successor`, it means that the in-order successor was the left child of the parent. So, we update `parent->left` to point to `successor->right`, effectively removing the in-order successor from its position.
- If `parent->left != successor`, it means that the in-order successor was not the left child but somewhere deeper in the right subtree. So, we update `parent->right` to point to `successor->right`.

6. Finally, `delete successor;` is used to deallocate the memory occupied by the in-order successor, as it has been moved into the `current` node.

By following these steps, you effectively delete a node with two children while maintaining the binary search tree property. The in-order successor from the right subtree is used to maintain the ordering of the BST.
<br>

`In-order Successor?`
<br>

The in-order successor of a mode in Binary Search Tree (BST) is the node that has the smallest key value that is greater than the key value of the given node. In other words, it's the node that represents the next value in the sorted order when performing an in-order traversal of the BST.

To find the in-order successor of a node, you typically follow these rules:

1. If the node has a right child, the in-order successor is the leftmost (smallest) node in the right subtree of the current node. You traverse left from the right child until you reach the leftmost node.
2. If the node does not have a right child, you need to move up the tree to find the in-order successor. You move up the tree from the current node toward the root until you find a node where you are coming from its left subtree. The parent of this node is the in-order successor.

Finding the in-order successor is essential when you want to delete a node from a BST with two children. The in-order successor is used to replace the node you are deleting, ensuring that the BST's properties are maintained.

In summary, the in-order successor is the next node in the in-order traversal of the BST and can be found by following specific rules based on the structure of the tree.

Let's undertand this with an `example`.

Suppose we have the following BST:

```txt
        50
       /  \
     30    70
    / \   /  \
  20  40 60  80

```

We want to delete the node with the value 50. Here are the steps:

1. Start at the root and traverse the tree to find the node with the value to be deleted, in this case, 50. We keep track of the current node and its parent as we traverse the tree.

- We start at the root (current = 50).
- Compare 50 with the value to be deleted (50).
- We found the node we want to delete.

2. Determine the number of children the node to be deleted has.

- The node with value 50 has two children (30 on the left and 70 on the right).

3. Case 1: If the node to be deleted has no children or one child:

- In our case, this is not applicable because the node with the value 50 has two children.

4. Case 2: If the node to be deleted has two children:

- Find the in-order successor of the node to be deleted. In this case, it's the smallest node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted.
- The in-order successor is 60 (the leftnost node in the right subtreee of the node with value 50).

5. Replace the value of the node to be deleted with the value of the in-order successor.

- Replace 50 with 60.

```txt
        60
       /  \
     30    70
    / \   /  \
  20  40 60  80
```

1. Remove the in-order successor from its orginal position in the right subtree.

- The original node with value 60 in the right subtree is now a duplicate, so you can remove it.

```txt
        60
       /  \
     30    70
    / \      \
  20  40     80
```

Now, you've successfully deleted the node with the value 50 from BST, and the tree maintains its binary search tree properties. The in-order traversal of the modified tree will give you the sorted order of the elements.

### What is the purpose of having inorder, preorder and postorder traversals?

In computer science and data structures, the purpose of having in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals for binary trees, including Binary Search Trees (BSTs), is to enable various operations and analyses on the tree's nodes. Each of these traversal orders serves a specific purpose and can be used in for different types of tree-related tasks:

1. **In-Order Traversal (Left-Root-Right)**:

- Purpose: In-order traversal is primarily used for visiting the nodes of binary tree in sorted order. It allows you to access the nodes in ascending order of their keys or values in the case of a BST.
- Applications:
  - Searching for a specific value in a BST.
  - Printing the nodes in sorted order.
  - Checking whether a binary tree is a valid BST by verifying that the nodes are visited in the correct order.

2. **Pre-Order Traversal (Root-Left-Right)**:

- Purpose: Pre-order traversal is useful for operations that require visiting the root node before its children. It's often used to create a copy of a tree or for generating a prefix expression from an expression tree.
- Applications:
  - Creating a copy of a tree.
  - Expression evaluation when using expression trees.
  - Serialization and deserialization of a tree.

3. **Post-Order Traversal (Left-Right-Root)**:

- Purpose: Post-order traversal is used for operations where you need to visit the children of a node before visiting the node itself. It's often used for tasks that involve deleting nodes or freeing memory.
- Applications:
  - Deleting nodes in a binary tree or a BST while maintaining its structure.
  - Calculating the height of a binary tree.
  - Memory cleanup and freeing resources in a tree data structure.

These traversal orders are essential for a wide range of tree-related tasks, and each order has a specific use case that makes it more suitable for certain operations. By using the appropriate traversal order, you can efficiently perform the tasks you eed to accomplish while navigating the tree in a systematic manner.

### Does nested loops always result in O(n^2) complexity. Explain with examples.

Nested loops do not always result in O(n^2) complexity; the actual time complexity depends on the number of iterations and the relationship between the loop indices. The "O(n^2)" complexity typically refers to situations where you have two nested loops iterating over the same input of size 'n', resulting in n\*n = n^2 iteations. However, the actual complexity can vary based on factors like loop indices and step sizes.

Here are some examples to illustrate different scenarios:

1. Constant-Time Nested Loop (O(1)):

```python
for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        print(i, j)
```

In this case, the nested loops have constant bounds (10 in this example), so the number of iterations is fixed, resulting in O(1) complexity. It's not O(n^2).

2. Linear-Nested Loops (O(n)):

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)
```

In this case, the number of iterations is n\*n, which is O(n^2) in terms of input size n.

3. Nested Loops with Different Indicies (O(m\*n)):

```python
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)
```

If the nested loops have different bounds 'm' and 'n', the complexity in O(m\*n), not O(n^2).

4. Incremental Step Nested Loops (O(n^2/4)):

```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    for j in range(1, n, 2):
        print(i, j)
```

If the nested loops use incrementing steps (in this case, skipping even numbers), the number of iterations is reduced. In this example, it would be roughly n^2/4 iterations.

In summary, the time complexity of nested loops is not always O(n^2). It depends on the specific conditions of the loops, such as their bounds, step sizes, and the relationship between the loop indices. The "O(n^2)" complexity is a common scenario but not the only possibility.

### What is Morris Travesal? Why is it recommended?

Morris Traversal is a clever and efficient technique for traversing binary trees, which includes all three classic tree traversal types: preorder, inorder, and postorder. It's recommended because it allows you to perform tree traversals without using extra space (like a stack or recursion) other than the implicit call stack used by the CPU.

The key idea behind Morris Traversal is to establish a link from the current node being visited to its in-order predecessor, and then use this link to backtrack when needed, thus eliminating the need for an explicit stack. This saves space and makes the traversal process more memory-efficient.

Here's a brief explanation of how Morris Traversal works for each of three traversal types:

1. Inorder Morris Traversal:

- Initialize the current node as the root of the tree.
- While the current node is not null:
  - If the current node has no left child, visit the node, and move it to the right child.
  - If the current node has a left child:
    - Find the in-order predecessor of the current node (the rightmost node in the its left subtree).
    - Make the in-order predecessor point to the current node (creating a temporary link).
    - Move to the left child of the current node.
    - When you reach a node with a null left child, it's time to visit the current node, break the temporary link, and move to the right child.
  - Repeat this process until you've traversed all nodes.

2. Preorder Morris Traversal:

   - Initialize the current node as the root of the tree.
   - While the current node is not null.
     - If the current node has no left child, visit the node, and move to the right child.
     - If the current node has a left child:
       - Find the in-order predecessor of the current node.
       - If the right child of the in-order predecessor is null, create a link from the in-order predecessor to the current node, visit the current node, and move to its left child.
       - If the right child of the in-order predecessor points to the current node (indicating that we have already visited the left subtree), break the link, and move to the right child.

3. Postorder Morris Traversal:
   - The idea is somewhat similar to the in-order traversal with slight modifications.
   - You visit nodes in reverse order compared to in-order traversal. This means you first visit the right subtree before the left subtree and the root.
   - You reverse the right child links when visiting nodes to allow for the reversed postorder traversal.

The Morris Traversal technique is recommended in interviews because it's an elegant way to traverse trees with O(1) space complexity, which is a common interview challenge. However, it may require more effort to understand and implement compared to traditional recursive or stack-based methods. Therefore, it's essential to practice and understand the underlying logic thoroughly to use it effectively in an interview setting.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void inorderMorrisTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    TreeNode* current = root;
    while (current) {
        if (current->left == nullptr) {
            cout << current->val << " ";
            current = current->right;
        } else {
            TreeNode* predecessor = current->left;
            while (predecessor->right && predecessor->right != current) {
                predecessor = predecessor->right;
            }
            if (predecessor->right == nullptr) {
                predecessor->right = current;
                current = current->left;
            } else {
                predecessor->right = nullptr;
                cout << current->val << " ";
                current = current->right;
            }
        }
    }
}

void preorderMorrisTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    TreeNode* current = root;
    while (current) {
        if (current->left == nullptr) {
            cout << current->val << " ";
            current = current->right;
        } else {
            TreeNode* predecessor = current->left;
            while (predecessor->right && predecessor->right != current) {
                predecessor = predecessor->right;
            }
            if (predecessor->right == nullptr) {
                cout << current->val << " ";
                predecessor->right = current;
                current = current->left;
            } else {
                predecessor->right = nullptr;
                current = current->right;
            }
        }
    }
}

### How is `a = a + 1` taking place?

In C++, the expression `a = a + 1` is a common operation that is often used to increament the value of a variable `a` by 1. It might seem a bit conterintuitive at first, but it's a fundamental concept in programming and is quite straightforward.

Let's break down how this operation works:

1. **Variable Declaration:** First, you must have declared and defined the variable `a` somewhere in your code. For example:

```cpp
int a = 5; // Here, `a` is declared and initialized with the value 5.
```

2. [Most Important] **Assignment:** In C++, the `=` symbol is used for assignment. It takes the value on the right and assigns it to the variable on the left. So, `a = a + 1` is essentially saying "Take the current value of `a` , add 1 to it, and then store that new back into `a`."

3. **Evaluation:** The expression on the right side of `=` is `a + 1`. It takes the current value of `a` (which is 5 in our example) and adds 1 to it. So, `5 + 1` evaluates to 6.

4. **Assignment:** The result of the evaluation, which is 6, is then assigned back to `a`. This means that after the statement `a = a + 1` is executed, the new value of `a` is 6.

Here's, the step-by-step breakdown:

- `a` is initially set to 5.
- `a + 1` is evaluated, resulting in 6.
- The result, 6, is assigned back to `a`.
- Now, `a` is updated to 6.

This is a fundamental concept in programming and is often used for various purposes, including increamenting or modifying variables as your program runs. It's important to understand that variables in most programming languages, including C++, can change their values over time, and this is one way to achieve that. This kind of operation is so common that C++ provides a shorthand notation for it: `a += 1`, which is equivalent to `a = a + 1`.

### In this statement `string a = "";`, what is exactly stored in `a`? Is `empty` same as `NULL` or `nullptr`?

In the statement `string a = "";`, an empty string is stored in the variable `a`. An empty string is a string that contains no characters, meaning it has a length of 0. In C++, when you initialize a `std::string` variable with an empty pair of double qoutes `""`, it means that the variable `a` is assigned an empty string as its initial value.

Here's what's happening in that statement:

1. `string` is date type indicating that `a` is a string variable.
2. `a` is the name of the variable.
3. `=""` is the assignment part, where you are initializing `a` with an empty string.

So, after executing `string a = "";`, variable `a` with an empty string with a length of 0. You can later modify the content of `a` by assigning different string values to it using assignment (`=`) or string manipulation functions in C++.

An empty string, `NULL`, and `nullptr` are not same things; they have different meanings and usages in C++.

1. **Empty String:** An empty string is a valid string that contains no characters. In C++, an empty string is represented as a string object with a length of 0. You can create an empty string by initializing it with double quotes, like `string a = "";`.
2. **NULL:** `NULL` typically refer to a null pointer. In C and older versions of C++, `NULL` is often used to represent a null pointer, which means it doesn't point to any memory location. In C++, it's recommended to use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` for pointer-related operations. For example, you can have a pointer like `int *ptr = nullptr;` to indicate that the pointer is noy pointing to any valid memory location.
3. **nullptr:** `nullptr` is a C++11 feature that represents a null pointer in a type-safe manner. It's used to indicate that a pointer doesn't point to any object. Using `nullptr` is preferred over `NULL` in modern C++ code because it avoids many common pointer-related issues.

To summarize, an empty string is a valid string with no characters, while `NULL` and `nullptr` are used to represent null or invalid pointers. They have different purposes and should not to be confused with each other.
