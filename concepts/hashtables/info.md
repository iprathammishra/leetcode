## Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to map keys to specific locations (buckets) in an array,where the corresponding values are stored. I'll break down the implementation into the following steps.

1. Chossing a Hash Function
2. Defining the Hash Table Data Strucuture. (items and table)
3. Inserting into the Hash Table.
4. Searching for Items in the Hash Table.
5. Handling Collisions.
6. Deleting from the Hash Table.

Main driver program is [here](main.cpp).
